# Ball and Beam

Balances a ball on a beam (treated as a two dimensional object) using a servo arm and a PID controller. The proportional, integral, and derivative terms were calculated based on experimentation on the specific setup we used. The ball is kept approximately at the center of the beam by tilting the beam using an "arm" attached to a servo. The arm we used was a bent and cut paperclip.
